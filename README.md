# Stable Diffusion
This is an app I made just to practice my frontend development skills in HTML and CSS

Basically this is a Flask app that takes in a prompt and amount of results from the user, then displays the results on another page. 

I used the [OpenAI Python library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction?lang=python) to use stable diffusion to generate the results.
